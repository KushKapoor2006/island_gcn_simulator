Generated graph with 268 nodes.
Ground truth community sizes: [32, 32, 54, 54, 96]
Hardware c_max (nodes per PE): 64

--- Running Simulation: Baseline I-GCN (Rigid c_max) ---
Baseline Locator: Splitting large community of size 268 into chunks of 64.
Locator created 5 islands, resulting in 1083 cut edges.
Calculating fragmentation penalty for 1083 cut edges...
Fragmentation added 227430.00 ns and 541.50 KB
Simulation finished. Total time: 350126.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 675.50 KB
PE Utilization: 13.44 %

--- Running Simulation: Enhanced I-GCN (Adaptive) ---
Enhanced Locator: Community 268 too large, splitting.
Locator created 3 islands, resulting in 631 cut edges.
Simulation finished. Total time: 220388.00 ns
