Generated graph with 268 nodes.
Ground truth community sizes: [32, 32, 54, 54, 96]
Hardware c_max (nodes per PE): 64

--- Running Simulation: Baseline I-GCN (Rigid c_max) ---
Baseline Locator: Splitting large community of size 268 into chunks of 64.
Locator created 5 islands, resulting in 1071 cut edges.
Calculating fragmentation penalty for 1071 cut edges...
Fragmentation added 224910.00 ns and 535.50 KB
Simulation finished. Total time: 343254.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 669.50 KB
PE Utilization: 13.39 %

--- Running Simulation: Enhanced I-GCN (Adaptive) ---
Enhanced Locator: Community 268 too large, splitting.
Locator created 3 islands, resulting in 629 cut edges.
