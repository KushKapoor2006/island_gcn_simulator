Generated graph with 124 nodes.
Ground truth community sizes: [16, 16, 22, 22, 48]
Hardware c_max (nodes per PE): 32

--- Running Simulation: Baseline I-GCN (Rigid c_max) ---
Baseline Locator: Splitting large community of size 124 into chunks of 32.
Locator created 4 islands, resulting in 253 cut edges.
Calculating fragmentation penalty for 253 cut edges...
Fragmentation added 53130.00 ns and 126.50 KB
Simulation finished. Total time: 89554.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 188.50 KB
PE Utilization: 28.26 %

--- Running Simulation: Enhanced I-GCN (Adaptive) ---
Enhanced Locator: Community 124 too large, splitting.
Locator created 2 islands, resulting in 83 cut edges.
Simulation finished. Total time: 65764.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 62.00 KB
PE Utilization: 73.78 %
