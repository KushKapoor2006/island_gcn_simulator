Generated graph with 124 nodes.
Ground truth community sizes: [16, 16, 22, 22, 48]
Hardware c_max (nodes per PE): 32

--- Running Simulation: Baseline I-GCN (Rigid c_max) ---
Baseline Locator: Splitting large community of size 124 into chunks of 32.
Locator created 4 islands, resulting in 268 cut edges.
Calculating fragmentation penalty for 268 cut edges...
Fragmentation added 34840.00 ns and 67.00 KB
Simulation finished. Total time: 52832.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 98.00 KB
PE Utilization: 24.34 %

--- Running Simulation: Enhanced I-GCN (Adaptive) ---
Enhanced Locator: Community 124 too large, splitting.
Locator created 2 islands, resulting in 83 cut edges.
Simulation finished. Total time: 33956.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 31.00 KB
PE Utilization: 73.82 %
