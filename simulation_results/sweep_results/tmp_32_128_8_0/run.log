Generated graph with 268 nodes.
Ground truth community sizes: [32, 32, 54, 54, 96]
Hardware c_max (nodes per PE): 64

--- Running Simulation: Baseline I-GCN (Rigid c_max) ---
Baseline Locator: Splitting large community of size 268 into chunks of 64.
Locator created 5 islands, resulting in 1061 cut edges.
Calculating fragmentation penalty for 1061 cut edges...
Fragmentation added 222810.00 ns and 530.50 KB
Simulation finished. Total time: 340514.00 ns
Total DRAM traffic: 664.50 KB
PE Utilization: 13.67 %

--- Running Simulation: Enhanced I-GCN (Adaptive) ---
Enhanced Locator: Community 268 too large, splitting.
Locator created 3 islands, resulting in 633 cut edges.
Simulation finished. Total time: 213348.00 ns
